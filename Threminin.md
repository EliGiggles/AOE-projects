Series resistance: R1 + R2 (additive)
Parallel resistance R = 1/(1/R1 +1/R2 ...) (always gets smaller as the denumerator gets bigger)

Trimming resistors: add a series resistor to trim up, and a paralell resistor to trim down

Conductance: the inverse of resistance: paralell conductances sum while series conductances subtract
