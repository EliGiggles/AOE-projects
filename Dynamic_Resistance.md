Ohm's Law: V = IR, so R = V/I

Some devices do not let a linear amount of current through as voltage increases
Dynamic Resistance: dV/dI (rate of change of voltage relative to current) from some starting point

Example:

A zener might have a dynamic resistance of 10 Ω at 10 mA, at its specified Zener voltage of 5v

If you increase the current by 25%, ΔV = RdynΔI = 10 * 0.25 * 10 = 25 mv

5.025/5 = 1.005 ΔV/V

A Zener regulator:

ΔIout = ΔVin - ΔVout / R

ΔVout = Rdyn/R(ΔVin - ΔVout)
