Series resistance: R1 + R2 (additive)
Parallel resistance R = 1/(1/R1 +1/R2 ...) (always gets smaller as the denumerator gets bigger)

Trimming resistors: add a series resistor to trim up, and a paralell resistor to trim down

Conductance: the inverse of resistance: paralell conductances sum while series conductances subtract

Voltage divider
vout over r2
r2/r1+r2 * vin

Current source: mantains a constant current between terminals
Voltage Source: mantains a contstant voltage across terminals
  - Batteries are voltage sources with series resistors
