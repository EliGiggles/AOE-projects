Q=CV
If a capacitor has V volts across its terminals and capacitance C, then it has Q columbs of charge on each terminal

Coulombs: units of charge. One Coulomb of charge will sustain a current of one amp for one second

plate area A, seperation d
capacitance = 8.85×10^−14 εA/d Farads
Capacitance: the amount of charge it takes to raise the potential of a capacitor by 1 volt
  1 Farad = 1 Columb/ 1 volt

Current through a capacitor = dV/dT
Stored energy in a capacitor = 0.5CV^2

Capacitors in paralell: Ctotal * V= Qtotal = Q1 + Q2 + Q3
 
Capacitors in series: 1/((1/c1) + (1/c2) ...)
