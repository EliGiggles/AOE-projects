Thevenin's Therom: any voltage-sorce/resistor network can be modeled as a voltage source and a series resistor.

Thevenin voltage: the open-circut voltage of a circut (no load on the output)

Thevenin Resistance: Vopen/i(load shorted)

For a voltage divider r1 - R2, the circut's open-circut voltage is the voltage across R2
