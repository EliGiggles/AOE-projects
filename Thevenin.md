Thevenin's Therom: any voltage-sorce/resistor network can be modeled as a voltage source and a series resistor.

Thevenin voltage: the open-circut voltage of a circut (no load on the output)

Thevenin Resistance: Vopen/i(load shorted)

For a voltage divider r1 - R2, the circut's open-circut voltage is the voltage across R2

Short current = vin/r1

Voltage = Vin*r2/R1+R2
Resistance = R1/Vin * Vin*r2/R1+R2


Example


30* 10/20

15v vthrev

short circut

30/10k 0.003
15/0.003
15v, 5000 ohms

10v threv

15v/50000 = 0.003 amps

10v voltage, resistance = v/r, 3,333 ohms 

0.003^2*3333 =  0.03w
