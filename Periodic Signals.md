Amplitude of a sinewave:

Peak-to-Peak, root-mean-square amplitude (square root of all the points squared) = 0.707 * vPeak


Decibels:

The number of decibels in a power ratio: 10 times log10(ratio) (the power you need to raise 10 to in order to get the ratio)

Twenty times for amplitudes

Decibels are always relative to something - if you just see decibels it is in reference to:

1v RMS, the voltage required to output 1 mW at some load impedance

Other types of signals:

Ramp: continuously increasing voltage

Sawtooth: Ramp with decrease
