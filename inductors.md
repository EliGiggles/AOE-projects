Inductors: Like capacitors - except V = L*dI/dT

Product of the right-hand rule - changing current creates a magnetic field (and so opposing voltage)

Energy = 1/2*L*i^2
Inductance = flux through inductor/current nessecary to produce that flux
Flux porportional (in a coil) to number of turns squared

K= 1.0 or 0.395 for dimensions in inches or centimeters, respectively

Works when l > 0.4d

The averange voltage across both these inductors must be zero - otherwise the current keeps increasing.
