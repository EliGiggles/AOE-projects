Transformers: two coupled coils (primary and secondary) that convert current into voltage.
voltage multiplication proportional to the turns ratio of the transformer
A transformer with turns ratio n has impedance of n2
Both sides of a transformer are isolated from each other

Nonidealness:
- they have paralel and series inductances causing leakage
